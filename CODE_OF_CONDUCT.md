# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We, as contributors and maintainers of the `x-sdk-ts` project, pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone. We welcome individuals regardless of:

- Age
- Body size
- Disability
- Ethnicity
- Gender identity and expression
- Level of experience
- Nationality
- Personal appearance
- Race
- Religion
- Sexual identity and orientation

Our goal is to foster an open and inclusive environment where developers can collaborate on building a simple, versatile, and type-safe SDK for the Twitter API.

## Our Standards
We encourage behaviors that contribute to a positive and constructive community, including:

- **Using welcoming and inclusive language**: Make everyone feel valued, from beginners to seasoned developers.
- **Respecting differing viewpoints and experiences**: Embrace diverse perspectives in discussions, code reviews, and feature planning.
- **Gracefully accepting constructive criticism**: Use feedback as an opportunity to improve the project.
- **Focusing on what’s best for the community**: Prioritize collective growth and the project’s success.
- **Showing empathy**: Support fellow contributors, especially those new to TypeScript, OAuth, or the Twitter API.

Unacceptable behaviors include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, or unwelcome advances.
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, or personal/political attacks.
- Public or private harassment of any kind.
- Publishing others’ private information (e.g., emails or personal details) without explicit permission.
- Any conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional or collaborative setting.

## Our Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for:

- Clearly defining and communicating standards of acceptable behavior.
- Taking fair, consistent, and appropriate corrective action when these standards are violated.
- Ensuring the `x-sdk-ts` community remains a welcoming space for all contributors.

Maintainers are not exempt from these rules and are held to the same standards as all community members.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including:

- The GitHub repository (https://github.com/Micka33/x-sdk-ts), including issues, pull requests, and code comments.
- Any associated communication channels (e.g., Discord, Slack, or email threads) established for the project.
- Public spaces where an individual represents the `x-sdk-ts` project, such as conferences, meetups, or online forums.

## Enforcement
If you experience or witness abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior, please report it by openning an empty issue named [ABUSE] and the project maintainers will contact you. All reports will be:

- Reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
- Kept confidential to the extent possible.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to:

- Remove, edit, or reject contributions (e.g., comments, code, issues) that violate this Code of Conduct.
- Temporarily or permanently ban contributors for behaviors deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Consequences will be applied proportionally based on the severity and context of the violation.
